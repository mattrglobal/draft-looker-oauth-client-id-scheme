1.  Introduction

   In the traditional OAuth 2.0 model [RFC6749], the authorization
   server (AS) registers and assigns an identifier to a client through a
   registration process, during which the authorization server records
   certain characteristics about the client, commonly known as its
   metadata.

   This requirement for registration greatly reduces how dynamic the
   relationship between a client and authorization server can be.  For
   instance, a client that is updating the capabilities it supports must
   update its registration(s) with affected authorization servers for
   this change to be recognized.  This requirement also affects
   deployments that feature many clients and authorization servers
   whereby requiring the client to be registered with and maintain this
   registration with an authorization server is costly.

   To enable a more dynamic relationship between a client and an
   authorization server, dynamic client registration via [RFC7591] was
   introduced.  This model allows a client to register dynamically with
   a supporting authorization server by sending a registration request.
   Although this mechanism does provide some benefits it also introduces
   new operational challenges for both the client and AS.  For instance
   clients that interface with many authorization servers are burdened
   with having to manage a client identifier per authorization server
   and in some cases forced to re-register the same client instance
   multiple times due to local storage limitations.  Furthermore,
   protecting the authorization servers registration endpoint forces
   other design tradeoffs, typically either the authorization server
   enforces some form of authentication (e.g a "registration_token") for
   registration requests, which is often problematic for public clients
   to manage/obtain.  Or the authorization server permits any
   registration request and has to mitigate potential spam/malicious
   registration requests via some other mechanism.

   Instead of requiring a registration process, this specification
   describes a model where a client identifies itself to the
   authorization server with its client_uri, which can be resolved to
   its metadata in a similar way to how an authorization server makes
   its metadata available to a client via [RFC8414].

   The metadata for a client is retrieved from a .well-known location as
   a JSON [RFC8259] document, which declares its endpoint locations and
   client capabilities, this process is described in Obtaining Client
   Metadata (Section 3).  Once the client metadata is retrieved and
   processed by the authorization server, the client can interact with
   the authorization server like any other client.

   This specification defines a new request parameter 'client_discovery'
   to indicate that the interacting client has no prior registration
   with the authorization server and instead has resolvable metadata
   that describes its endpoint locations and capabilities.

   This specification uses the metadata elements defined in the client
   registration specification [RFC7591] and no additional metadata
   fields or formats are defined in this specification.

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification uses the terms "access token", "refresh token",
   "authorization server", "resource server", "authorization endpoint",
   "authorization request", "authorization response", "token endpoint",
   "grant type", "access token request", "access token response",
   "client", "public client", and "confidential client" defined by The
   OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework [RFC6749].

   The terms "request", "response", "header field", and "target URI" are
   imported from [RFC9110].

2.  Client Metadata

   Clients can have metadata described in their configuration.  Examples
   of existing registered metadata fields that a client can make use of
   can be found at the OAuth 2.0 dynamic client registration metadata
   IANA registry [RFC 7591] (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/
   rfc7591.html#section-4.1).

   The client's published metadata MUST include the client_uri field as
   defined in section 2 of RFC7591 [RFC7591].  The value of this field
   MUST be a URI as defined in RFC3986 [RFC3986] with a scheme component
   that MUST be https, a host component, and optionally, port and path
   components and no query or fragment components.  Additionally, host
   names MUST be domain names and MUST NOT be IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

3.  Obtaining Client Metadata

   A Client supporting metadata discovery MUST make a JSON document
   containing metadata as specified in RFC7591 [RFC7591] available at a
   path formed by inserting a well-known URI string into the client_uri
   between the host component and the path component, if any.  By
   default, the well-known URI string used is "/.well-known/oauth-
   client".  This path MUST use the "https" scheme.  The syntax and
   semantics of ".well-known" are defined in RFC 5785 [RFC5785].  The
   well-known URI suffix used MUST be registered in the IANA "Well-Known
   URIs" (https://www.iana.org/assignments/well-known-uris) registry.

   Different clients utilizing OAuth 2.0 in application-specific ways
   may define and register different well-known URI suffixes used to
   publish client metadata as used by those applications, for example
   using a well-known URI string such as "/.well-known/example-
   configuration".  Alternatively, many such clients will use the
   default well-known URI string "/.well-known/oauth-client", which is
   the right choice for general-purpose OAuth 2.0 applications.

   An OAuth 2.0 client using this specification MUST specify what well-
   known URI suffix it will use for this purpose.  The same client MAY
   choose to publish its metadata at multiple well-known locations
   derived from its client_uri, for example, publishing metadata at both
   "/.well-known/example-configuration" and "/.well-known/oauth-client".

   Some OAuth 2.0 applications will choose to use the well-known URI
   suffix "openid-federation", as described in Compatibility Notes
   (Section 8).

3.1.  Client Metadata Request

   A client metadata document MUST be queried using an HTTP "GET"
   request at the previously specified path.  The OAuth 2.0
   authorization server would make the following request when the
   client_uri is "https://client.example.com" and the well-known URI
   suffix is "oauth-client" to obtain the metadata, since the client_uri
   contains no path component:

   GET /.well-known/oauth-client HTTP/1.1
   Host: client.example.com

   If the client_uri value contains a path component, any terminating
   "/" MUST be removed before inserting "/.well-known/" and the well-
   known URI suffix between the host component and the path component.
   The OAuth 2.0 authorization server would make the following request
   when the client_uri is "https://client.example.com/client1" and the
   well-known URI suffix is "oauth-client" to obtain the metadata, since
   the client_uri contains a path component:

   GET /.well-known/oauth-client/client1 HTTP/1.1
   Host: client.example.com

   Using path components enables supporting multiple clients per host.
   This is required in some complex client configurations.  This use of
   ".well-known" is for supporting multiple clients per host; unlike its
   use in RFC 5785 [RFC5785], it does not provide general information
   about the host.

3.2.  Client Metadata Response

   The response is a set of metadata values describing client's
   configuration, including all valid redirection URIs and features
   supported by the client.  A successful response MUST use the 200 OK
   HTTP status code and return a JSON object using the "application/
   json" content type that contains a set of metadata fields and values
   as defined in Client Metadata (Section 2).  Other metadata fields MAY
   also be returned.

   Metadata fields that return multiple values are represented as JSON
   arrays.  Metadata fields with no values MUST be omitted from the
   response.

   An error response uses the applicable HTTP status code value.

   The following is a non-normative example response:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
       "client_uri": "https://client.example.com",
       "client_name": "My Example Client",
       "redirect_uris": [
           "https://client.example.com/cb",
           "https://client.example.com/cb2"
       ],
       "logo_uri": "https://client.example.com/logo.png",
       "jwks_uri": "https://client.example.com/my_public_keys.jwks",
       "tos_uri": "https://client.example.com/tos",
       "policy_uri": "https://client.example.com/policy",
       "example_extension_parameter": "example_value"
   }

3.3.  Client Metadata Validation

   The client_uri value returned in the client metadata response MUST be
   identical to the client_uri value into which the well-known URI
   string was inserted to create the URL used to retrieve the metadata.
   If these values are not identical, the data contained in the response
   MUST NOT be used.

   The following sections describe the mechanism through which a client
   communicates its metadata discovery url.

4.  Authorization Request Using Client Discovery

   A client can indicate to an authorization server that it has
   discoverable metadata in an authorization request via the
   "client_discovery" request parameter.  Presence of this parameter in
   an authorization request with a value of "true" indicates to the
   authorization server that the "client_id" value of the authorization
   request is a URL encoded value corresponding to the "client_uri" for
   the client and if the authorization server does not already have the
   metadata for the identified client it can retrieve the metadata by
   following the procedure outlined in Client Metadata
   Section (Section 2).

   The following is a non-normative example request of a client making
   an authorization request to an authorization server with the
   "client_discovery" parameter:

   GET /authorize?response_type=code
       &client_id=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.com
       &client_discovery=true
       &state=af0ifjsldkj
       &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.com%2Fcb
   HOST: server.example.com

   The value of the "client_id" parameter in the authorization request
   MUST represent the URL encoded form of the "client_uri" value for the
   corresponding client.  The "client_id" value MUST be URL decoded by
   the authorization server to obtain the "client_uri" value which can
   be used to resolve the client metadata as described in the Obtaining
   Client Metadata (Section 3) section.

   *TODO stipulate new error responses*

5.  Token Request Using Client Discovery

   A client can indicate to an authorization server that it has
   discoverable metadata in an token request via the "client_discovery"
   request parameter.  Presence of this parameter in a token request
   with a value of "true" indicates to the authorization server that the
   "client_id" value of the token request represents then "client_uri"
   for the client and if the authorization server does not already have
   the metadata for the identified client it can retrieve the metadata
   by following the procedure outlined in Client Metadata
   Section (Section 2).

   The following is a non-normative example request of a client making
   an token request using "client_discovery" parameter:

   POST /token
   Host: server.example.com
   Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
   Accept: application/json

   grant_type=authorization_code
   &code=xxxxxxxx
   &client_id=https://client.example.com/
   &redirect_uri=https://client.example.com/redirect
   &code_verifier=a6128783714cfda1d388e2e98b6ae8221ac31aca31959e59512c59f5
   &client_discovery=true

   The "client_id" parameter is passed to the token request during
   client authentication (as described in the Section 3.2.1 of [RFC6749]
   (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-3.2.1)).  Clients in
   possession of a client password MAY use the HTTP Basic authentication
   scheme as defined in RFC 2617 [RFC2617] or MAY include the client
   credentials in the request-body to authenticate with the
   authorization server.

   In case of any errors, error response is returned (as described in
   the Section 5.2 of [RFC6749] (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/
   rfc6749#section-5.2)).  TODO expand

6.  String Operations

   Processing some OAuth 2.0 messages requires comparing values in the
   messages to known values.  For example, the member names in the
   metadata response might be compared to specific member names such as
   "client_uri".  Comparing Unicode [UNICODE] strings, however, has
   significant security implications.

   Therefore, comparisons between JSON strings and other Unicode strings
   MUST be performed as specified below:

   1.  Remove any JSON-applied escaping to produce an array of Unicode
       code points.

   2.  Unicode Normalization [USA15] MUST NOT be applied at any point to
       either the JSON string or the string it is to be compared
       against.

   3.  Comparisons between the two strings MUST be performed as a
       Unicode code-point-to-code-point equality comparison.

   Note that this is the same equality comparison procedure described in
   ( Section 8.3 of [RFC8259] (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/
   rfc8259#section-8.3)).

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  TLS Requirements

   Implementations MUST support TLS.  Which version(s) ought to be
   implemented will vary over time and depend on the widespread
   deployment and known security vulnerabilities at the time of
   implementation.  The client MUST support TLS version 1.2 [RFC5246]
   and MAY support additional TLS mechanisms meeting its security
   requirements.  When using TLS, the authorization server MUST perform
   a TLS/SSL server certificate check, per RFC 6125 [RFC6125].
   Implementation security considerations can be found in
   "Recommendations for Secure Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and
   Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)" [BCP195].

   To protect against information disclosure and tampering,
   confidentiality protection MUST be applied using TLS with a
   ciphersuite that provides confidentiality and integrity protection.

7.2.  Impersonation Attacks

   TLS certificate checking MUST be performed by the authorization
   server, as described in Section 7.1, when making a client metadata
   request.  Checking that the server certificate is valid for the
   "client_uri" URL prevents man-in-middle and DNS-based attacks.  These
   attacks could cause a authorization server to be tricked into using
   an attacker's keys and endpoints, which would enable impersonation of
   the legitimate client.  If an attacker can accomplish this, they can
   access the resources that the affected client has access to by
   impersonating their profile.

   An attacker may also attempt to impersonate a client by publishing a
   metadata document that contains a "client_uri" claim using the
   "client_uri" URL of the client being impersonated, but with its own
   endpoints and signing keys.  This would enable it to impersonate that
   client, if accepted by the authorization server.  To prevent this,
   the authorization server MUST ensure that the "client_uri" URL it is
   using as the prefix for the metadata request exactly matches the
   value of the "client_uri" metadata value in the client's metadata
   document received by the authorization server.
